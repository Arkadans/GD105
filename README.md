# GD105
This is my Repository for all the work and projects done on the GD 105 Class at Hostos Community College. 

This is a Code for Art & Design class, where we create art utilizing the software Processing, which runs on the coding language Java. 

Following is a breakdown of the folders:
The Practice_Drafts folders is mostly for myself so I can acess projects I am still working on any computer. 

The Projects_Assignments is where all the final revisions of my work are posted for each unit. Inside each folder there is a image showing the output of the program. 

The Resubmissions folder is where I post any work that I have revised after its due date.
